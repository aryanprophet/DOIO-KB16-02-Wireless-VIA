# DOIO-KB16-02-Wireless-VIA

This is for the WIRELESS version of the DOIO KB16B-02 also known as the Megalodon Triple Knob Wireless Macro Pad.

I bought mine from (WhatGeek)[https://www.whatgeek.com/products/doio-kb16b-02-macro-keyboard-updated-macro-pad] but it is also found at (KeebMonkey)[https://www.keebmonkey.com/products/megalodon-triple-knob-wireless-macro-pad]

I found the instructions and the .json files online to be completely wrong and after much trial and error, I found that my updated JSON worked best.

## Steps

1. Download [Vial](https://get.vial.today/download/)(Preferred) or [VIA 2.2.0](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases)
2. Connect your device via USB
3. Load the JSON File (Vial - Sideload, VIA 2.2.0 - Go to the design tab and upload the design)

Now you can update your macropad!

Enjoy!
